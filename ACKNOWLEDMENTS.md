# Acknowledgments

AbstractUIC is built on top of excellent open-source projects and the broader web ecosystem.

## Open-source foundations

- **React** and **React DOM** for UI composition (`react`, `react-dom`)
- **TypeScript** for types and build output (`typescript`)
- **ReactFlow** for graph visualization in `@abstractframework/monitor-active-memory` (`reactflow`)

## Thanks

Thanks to contributors and to the AbstractFramework community for shaping real-world requirements and feedback.
